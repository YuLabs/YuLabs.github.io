1. Spatial-Tempora Graph Convolution Network for Multichannel Speech Enhancement, ICASSP 2022

**Abstract:** Spatial dependency related to distributed sensor positions is essential for multichannel speech enhancement task. It is still challenging due to lack of accurate array positions and complex spatial-temporal relations of multichannel noisy signals. We proposes spatial-temporal network composed of cascaded spatial-temporal (ST) modules with adaptive channel fusion algorithm. Without any prior information of array and acoustic scene, a convolution block is designed with learnable adjacency matrix to capture the spatial dependency of pairwise channels. Then, it is embedded with time-frequency block as the ST module to fuse the multi-dimensional correlation features for target speech estimation. Furthermore, a novel weighted function based on speech intelligibility index is proposed to assign more attention for the important bands of human understanding during network training. Our framework has been demonstrated to achieve performance improvement against prior state-of-the-art approaches in multi-scene experiments.
